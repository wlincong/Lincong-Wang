# p2pCNN
Protein SSE assignments via p2p and cnn
The program for assigning protein secondary structure elements (SSEs) using a PDB file consists of two part. The first one is a C++ program p2p that computes the geometrical data of the p2p polyline using a PDF structure with protons. The output of the geometrical data is then used by the cnn model to assign the SSE for the protein. The corresponding program is the python program assignByNN.py. The trained model is about 60MB and could not be uploaded directly to Githut so I put it to Google Drive with the link "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1etVXwmxp5FjMRIlS8NYnLLJ6dDeg7IGy/view?usp=sharing". You may need email me for the permission. The model was trained using tensorflow2.3 so to run it, one need to install tensorflow. These programs have been tested on Ubuntu18.04 and Ubuntu20.04.
